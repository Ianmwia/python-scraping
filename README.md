## How it works

1. You will be requested to select a page to scrape from Jumia's own categories
the app will then use the request to scrape data for the specific path

2. You will receive a list of all the product categories in the chosen page

3. Select a category of choice to scrape and get a list of all the products in the jumia products categories each with its name and price

4. You can then choose to save the data in any file format like csv or txt or exit the app
